Script to make the frequent setup of your Athena test area less
uncomfortable.

To use it you'll need:
 - Make up you mind if you want to use the trunk or an older set of packages
   in a certain branch arrangement.
   This is to be specified by an additional argument when sourcing
   this script.

This script will:
 - Set up Athena in the (to be) specified directory. The path can
   be given as a second argument, otherwise you'll be asked to specify it.
